# Changelog

All notable changes to OCCTSwiftViewport are documented in this file.

## [0.53.0] — 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Bumped OCCTSwift dep to `from: "0.168.0"`** (was 0.165.0). Pulls in:
  - v0.166.0 / v0.166.1 — Swift Package Index metadata + platform-plan docs (no API change).
  - v0.167.0 — visionOS + tvOS xcframework slices (no API change).
  - v0.168.0 — `ImportProgress` protocol + cooperative cancellation for `Shape.loadSTEP` / `loadIGES` / `loadIGESRobust` and `Document.load` / `loadSTEP`.

### Added
- **v0.168 Import Progress demo** in `OCCT8Gallery` (`v168ImportProgress`). Writes a small fused box+cylinder STEP, then re-loads three times: with a recording observer (75 progress callbacks at last run), with an observer that requests cancellation after the first callback (catches `ImportError.cancelled`), and with `progress: nil` to confirm source-compat. Wired into the OCCT 8 sub-group in `SpikeView` and into the headless `--test-all-demos` runner.

## [0.52.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Renderer-side support for OCCTSwiftAIS manipulator widgets** (issue #23):
  - `ViewportBody.renderLayer: RenderLayer` (`.geometry` / `.overlay`). Overlay bodies are drawn after the selection outline with `depthCompareFunction = .always`, so manipulator arrows remain grabbable even when occluded by their target body. Overlay bodies are also rendered into the pick texture with always-pass depth.
  - `ViewportBody.pickLayer: PickLayer` (`.userGeometry` / `.widget`). `ViewportController.pickResult` now exposes only user-geometry picks; `ViewportController.widgetPickResult` (new) carries widget-layer picks. A single GPU pick pass populates both via the body's layer. Adds `onWidgetPick` callback and `clearWidgetPick()`.
  - `ViewportBody.transform: simd_float4x4`. Drives the per-body model matrix in the main, shadow, pick, and selection-outline passes — manipulator drags can now move a body without re-uploading vertex data.
  - `PickResult.pickLayer` field; the existing `init(rawValue:indexMap:)` gains an optional `layerMap:` parameter (existing call sites stay source-compatible).

## [0.51.0] — 2026-05-03

### Removed (breaking)
- **`OCCTSwiftTools` library product** has been extracted to its own repository: <https://github.com/gsdali/OCCTSwiftTools>. Consumers depending on the viewport's `OCCTSwiftTools` product must migrate to the standalone package (`>= 0.1.0`). This unblocks SwiftPM target-name uniqueness and lets OCCTSwiftTools tag its v0.1.0 release.
  - Removed sources: `BodyUtilities.swift`, `CADFileLoader.swift`, `CurveConverter.swift`, `ExportManager.swift`, `ScriptManifest.swift`, `SurfaceConverter.swift`, `WireConverter.swift` (already mirrored in the standalone repo).

### Changed
- `OCCTSwiftMetalDemo` (executable, dev aid only — not a library product) now depends on the external `OCCTSwiftTools` package via a local path dep (`../OCCTSwiftTools`) so the demo continues to build during the transition. This will be switched to a versioned remote dep once `OCCTSwiftTools v0.1.0` is published.

## [0.26.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Annotation Gallery** (`AnnotationGallery.swift`): Demonstrates OCCTSwift AIS annotation features — dimension measurements, text labels, and colored point clouds.
  - Length dimensions (point-to-point) with rendered dimension geometry (extension lines, markers)
  - Radius & diameter dimensions on cylinders and spheres
  - Angle dimensions between edges and from three-point configurations

## [0.25.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Naming Gallery** (`NamingGallery.swift`): Demonstrates OCCTSwift TNaming — topological naming history tracking on XDE documents.
  - Primitive history: creates a box, records it as a primitive, queries stored/current shape and naming history
  - Modification tracking: box → filleted box, records both steps, shows old (dim) vs new (shaded) with history
  - Forward/backward tracing: box − cylinder boolean, traces the naming graph in both directions
  - Named selection persistence: selects a face by name and resolves it back from the naming graph
- Sidebar section: **Naming Demos**

## [0.24.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Medial Axis Gallery** (`MedialAxisGallery.swift`): Computes and visualizes the Voronoi skeleton (medial axis) of planar shapes using OCCTSwift `MedialAxis` (BRepMAT2d).
  - Rectangle skeleton with inscribed circle node markers
  - L-shaped profile showing branching skeleton topology
  - Thickness map with arcs colored red (thin) to blue (thick) by wall distance
  - Custom T-profile skeleton with node/arc statistics
  - `computeForShape(_:)` API for use with STEP face selection
- Sidebar section: **Medial Axis Demos**

## [0.23.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Projection Gallery** (`ProjectionGallery.swift`): Projects 3D curves and points onto parametric surfaces using OCCTSwift `Surface.projectCurve3D`, `projectCurveSegments`, and `projectPoint`.
  - Curve on cylinder (diagonal line → helix on surface)
  - Curve on sphere (tilted circle → geodesic-like projection)
  - Composite projection with multi-segment UV coloring
  - Point projection with 20 scattered points, distance-colored lines (green=close, red=far)
- **Plate Gallery** (`PlateGallery.swift`): Creates and deforms plate surfaces using OCCTSwift `Surface.plateThrough`, `nlPlateDeformed` (G0), and `nlPlateDeformedG1` (G1).
  - Plate from scattered 3D points (terrain-like)
  - G0 position-constrained deformation (flat → curved)
  - G1 tangent-controlled deformation with direction arrows
- Sidebar sections: **Projection Demos**, **Plate Demos**

## [0.22.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Sweep Gallery** (`SweepGallery.swift`): Variable-section pipe sweeps using OCCTSwift `LawFunction` and `Shape.pipeShellWithLaw`.
  - Constant pipe (uniform cross-section)
  - Linear taper (narrowing from start to end)
  - S-curve sweep (smooth bulge)
  - Interpolated sweep (custom varying profile)
  - Each demo includes a 2D law function plot and spine wireframe overlay
- **GD&T display**: When STEP files with PMI data are loaded, dimensions, geometric tolerances, and datums are extracted and shown in a new **GD&T** sidebar section.

### Changed
- `CADLoadResult` now includes `dimensions: [DimensionInfo]`, `geomTolerances: [GeomToleranceInfo]`, and `datums: [DatumInfo]` arrays extracted from STEP documents via `Document.dimensions`, `Document.geomTolerances`, `Document.datums`.
