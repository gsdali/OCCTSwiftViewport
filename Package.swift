import PackageDescription

// NOTE: OCCTSwiftViewport is a leaf layer. Its library and test targets depend
// on NO other OCCTSwift package — it renders plain `ViewportBody` arrays and
// knows nothing about the kernel. The interactive demo, which DOES use the
// kernel and OCCTSwiftTools, lives in its own package at Examples/MetalDemo so
// that this published manifest never declares an upward dependency on Tools
// (which depends back on Viewport — a package cycle). See Examples/MetalDemo.
