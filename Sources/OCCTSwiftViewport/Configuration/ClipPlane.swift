/// A clipping plane that removes geometry on its negative side.

/// The plane equation is `dot(normal, point) + distance = 0`.

/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // Clip everything below Y = 0
/// let plane = ClipPlane(normal: SIMD3(0, 1, 0), distance: 0)
///
/// // Clip everything to the left of X = 2
/// let plane = ClipPlane(normal: SIMD3(1, 0, 0), distance: -2)
/// ```
